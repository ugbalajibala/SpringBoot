Camaunda question
------------------

*what is subprocess

*what is the embeded subprocess

*what is call activity

RestApi question
----------------

*what are the predefined tables given by camunda 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

what is the DMN ?

what you many by decision?

what you mean by rule?

what is the hit policy



what is the DMN ?

DMN is a standard 

DMN--decision model and notation

* you go and implement your business  rules in your workflow

when you go for decision model and notation
-------------------------------------------

*if you want some decision based on the your output then you go for DMN(decision model and notation)


Realtime example of the DMN
------------------------------

*Scenario: A bank wants to automate its loan approval process using Camunda BPM and DMN. The bank has two types of loans: personal loans and business loans. The approval criteria for these loans are different


*Scenario: A bank wants to automate the eligibility assessment for credit card applications using Camunda BPM and DMN


*Scenario: A retail store wants to automate the process of approving discounts for customer orders.


Decision result

*the output of the desicion also called decision result


Hit policy
-----------
* hit policy is a set in  the hit policy attribute on the decision table xml elememt,

UNIQE
-------

* if no hit policy is set , then  the default hit policy UNIQUE is used 


Hit policy
----------

*unique

*any 

*first

*priority

*collect

*collect(sum)

*collect(min)

*collect(max)

*collect(count)

*rule order

*output order


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------


what is the rule
--------------

Each rule contains input and output entries. The input entries are the condition and the output entries the conclusion of the rule.

the role of the hit policy
----------------------------

*a hit policy specifices how many rules of  a decision  table can be satisified  and which of the satified rules are included in decision result of the table 


the hit policy  unique, any , first always return  maximum  of one satified rule 

the hit policy rule order and collect can return multiple satified rule 


Unique hit policy
----------------

*only a single rule can be satified or no rule at all

*if more than one rule is satisfied  the unique hit policy violated 

any hit policy
-------------

*multiple rules can be satisfied ,however all satified rules must retrun the same output

* if multiple rules are satisfied which genarate different output the any hit policy violated 

first hit policy
---------------

*multiple rules can be satisfied ,the decision table result contaoins only the output of the first satified rule

rule order hit policy
--------------------

*multiple rules can be satisfied the decision table result contains output of all satified rules in the order of the rules in the decision table


collect hit policy
------------------

*multiple rules can be satisfied the decision table result contain the output of all satisfied rules in an rantom order as a list


*collect is called aggricate 
--------------------------------



what are the web application offered by camunda 
------------------------------------------------

    database layer------------->        Database  



Camunda 7 architecture have 3 layer 
--------------------------------------

* UI layer---(modeler---tasklist---custom application---cockpit----admin)

*core layer--(process engine)

*Data base layer---allow any database like mysql....oracal



three engine is there name is bpmn(business process model and notation) , cmmn( case management model and notatiom),dmn( decision model notation) 

engine is haed of the camunda 
-------------------------------
--------------------------------

file repository
---------------

*whenver you draw diagram from the camunda modeler  this deploy the diagram

modeler
----------

*modeler is a UI tool and to design a diagram 

tasklist
-------

*tasklist is a UI page and all the task listout in the tasklist



custom application
------------------

*


cockpit
--------

*cockpit is a UI and where you can see how many process running and what are process deployed like this 

admin
-----

*admin is a where admin activity will do 


Database
---------

*

some request from UI or any top of the ui model and it has to go via process engine only to a database 
 	  

----------------------------------------------------------------
intermediate events
-------------------

timer boundary event non interrupting----

do not disturb the original flow  

for example :- suppose if you have two user task you use timer boundary event non interrupting that task visible in two usertask 


timer boundary event interrupting

distrub the normal flow

JSON -- javascript object notation , it is easy for human read and write


different between json and xml
------------------------------

json-----javascript object notation

xml---extensiable markup language


json                                                                        xml
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* to store the text base format  like string                              markup language  like tags --html

*it is light weight                                                      it is heavy weight

*json type : string,number,array,boolean                             all xml data should be String 

*retrieving value is easy                                             difficult

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

json(String) to convert the object----var obj=json.parse(convert the json);

alert(typeof(obj))---output is object type

document.write(o.name+"age is"+o.age);--Balaji age is 21


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

External task 
-------------

*external task is  a unit of work that can be performed by external systems, workers, or applications. 


Service task
-----------
service tasks, which are executed directly within the process engine,

external task
-------------
external tasks are designed to be executed outside of the process engine

that require interactions with external systems, manual intervention, or long-duration processing.



when use the external task
--------------------------

if you want to interaction with external systems and long duration processing 


camunda only do go to the next task



camunda 7 
------------

* task handler or worker

task  assign the work to the worker

*camunda engine--workflow you draw and deploy --pushing machasium-camunda engine push the job to the job handler

*pushing machasium-camunda engine push the job to the job handler or task hanlder or worker

camunda 8
----------

*worker asked to the task work is have 

*polling machanisum 

*taskhadler or worker go and get the work from camunda engine  this is polling machanisum
