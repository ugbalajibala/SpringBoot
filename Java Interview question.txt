                                             java interview question
                                        ------------------------


markar interface:

* an interface is also knoe taged interface which has no method ex colonable interface, marked interafce empty interafce


1) what is the java?
                    * java is a high level language and platform indepent , java is a object oriented pogramming language but 100% not pure object oritened program language
and then java is secure language

2) different between c++ and java

c++                                                          java

it is a platform depend                                       it is a platform independent

c++ is  support to the pointor concept                      java is not support the pointor concept 

c++ is allow the call by value and call by reference       java is only allow the call by value
   
c++ mainly used for system progarmming                     java is mainly used for appalication programming



4) What do you understand by Java virtual machine?


Java Virtual Machine is a virtual machine that enables the computer to run the Java program and to execute the bye code into mechine code at any software or hardware



7.
Why is the main() method declared static?


main() method is called by the JVM even before the instantiation of the class , as non static mamber or method cannot be called with the class name directly so main method shold be declear static 


suppose if you remove the static keyword throw the nosunch method error


What is PATH
-------------


PATH
------ 
  * the classpath  variable is an environment variable which is used by application class loader



path is an environment variable which is used by Operating System to locate the exe files (.exe) or java binaries ( java or javac command).

What is CLASSPATH


class loder 
---------

* the classloader is a part of the java runtime environment that dynamically load java classes into the java vitrual mechine

* class loader is a part of the jvm which is used to load the class whenever we run the java program first load the class file by class loader


is also an environment variable which is used by Application ClassLoader to locate and load the .class files . CLASSPATH setting is done to locate the .class files found in another directory.


61) What is aggregation?
Aggregation can be defined as the relationship between two separate classes  aggregation represent the week relationship  ex depend on the any things,linke bank employee

62) what is the composition?

it focuses on the external lookout                           it focuses on internal working

it can implemented using abstraction and interface           it can  implemented using  access modigier


3) what is the enumuration in java?

enumration is a special data type which contain a set of predefined constanst 



4) can we interface is final?

you cannot make interface is finall because interface  have only abtract method that method must override the another class once class is finally declaer that class cannot be overide

5)can we declear interfce method static in java?

6)advandage of the encapsulation?

data hiding
code reusebility
flexibility and maintainabilty


7)what is the definition of the pacakage?

pacakage is a group of the smiliar type of classes and interafe sub package

there are two type
* build in pacage 
* user define pacage
8i) advan: 

java pacage provide access protection

java pacage remove naming collision 



9)what is the purpose of the final block?

final block execute important informtion 


10)what is the string bool ?

string pool is a storage space in the java heap memory where string litrals are stored is know as string constant pools


11) why are the object immutable in java 

mutable object

string buffer,string builder

immutable object
int long float double wrapper class string class

13) what is the ad and dis inner class? 


14) whare use the inner class/

15)how many method in java?

*two type method in java
there are predefined and used defined


16)what is the java?
java is the high level language

17)why is the java platform indepent

java byte code to execute any at any platform so java in a platform indepent


18) what is feature of the java and application in java?


feature:

*

19) what is the platform

The Javaâ„¢ platform is the environment for developing and managing Java applets and applications.

20)interpeter 

what :

* interpreter is a computer program that converts the high level language into assembly level language .when program is run it convert code into machine code

complier what:

* that transalaes a programming language soure coode into machine code

* in the first part the souce program complied and translated into the object program

* in the second part object program translated into the target program through the assembler


6) How many types of memory areas are allocated by JVM?
 
* class area-----java class filed stored

* heap area-----to store the object

 stacke area----to store the variable

 *Program Counter Register: 

*Native Method Stack

8) How many types of constructors are used in Java?



* defaule constructor

* paramatriced constructor


29) What is the purpose of a default constructor?


The purpose of the default constructor is to assign the default value to the objects.

    

32) Can you make a constructor final?

No, constructors cannot be marked as final in Java



No, the constructor can't be final.




7) What is JIT compiler?

JIT--just-in-time: to improve the program performance, to reduce the amount of time needed for complication,


11) What is classloader?


Classloader is a subsystem of JVM which is used to load class files. Whenever we run the java program, it is loaded first by the classloader

* the java classloader is a part of the java runtime environment that dynamically loads java classes into the java virtual mechine


23) What is object-oriented paradigm?




42) Why is the main method static?

Because the object is not required to call the static method. If we make the main method non-static, JVM will have to create its object first and then call main() method which will lead to the extra memory allocation



44)Can we execute a program without main() method?


Ans) No, It was possible before JDK 1.7 using the static block. Since JDK 1.7, it is not possible.





21) what the different between JdK,Jre ,JVM

22)java version

23)what is the date type int, float,char ,boolen

24) finall,finally finize



25)how many create object to classs


26)what is the copy constructor

a copy constructor is a special type of constructor that creates an object using another object of the same Java class. It returns a duplicate copy of an existing object of the class.


27)different betwwen static variable method block




 7 static variable
 
* static variable doesnt not change object to object   ,single copy will be craeted at class level and shared by every object of the class

static method
-----------------
 * static method doesnt change object to object single copy will be created at class level and shared by everyobject of the class


static block
------------
* Static block only exeute the static variable



Different between equals and ==

equals                                                        ==

equals method to compare content of the two object           == method to compare the address of the two object

This is a method defined in the Object class.                     	It is a binary operator in Java.

 





28) whare us the static variable

29) static keyword do use the class

30) string,string buuffer string builder

when to string:

* if the content is fixed and wont change frequently then we should go for string 

when to string buffer

* if the content is not fixed but thread safe is required then we dhould go for string buffer

* thread is not required




string                                               string buffer                                      string builder

* string is a immutable                           * string buffer is a mutable                      * string builder is a mutable
* it is not thread safety                          * it is  thread safety                           * it is not thread safety                           
* it is not syschronized                             it is  syschronized                           it is not syschronized   
                         



31) different betwwen error and exception

error :

many time error not  occure by programmer and duo to lack of source program ,error is non recoverable

eX: unchecked exception

exception

* many time exception occure by programmer and exception is a rocoverable 

ex: checked and unchecked exception



32)what is the jakuarray ?

33)why string is immutable?
* to momery management 

34) different betwwen interface and abstraction


 abstraction                                                                                    interface 
  

* abstraction have abstract method and non abstract method                       interface can have only abstract method

* abstraction class not support the multiple inheritance                         interface suppor the multiple inheriatance

* abstraction can have final non final,static non static varible                  interaface have only final and static

* abstraction class implement by extends                                         interafce implement by implements                             




35) what is the deadlog?

Deadlock in Java is a part of multithreading. Deadlock can occur in a situation when a thread is waiting for an object lock, that is acquired by another thread and second thread is waiting for an object lock that is acquired by first thread. Since, both threads are waiting for each other to release the lock, the condition is called deadlock.

36) why use the java ?

37)what is the default methos and why is recquired




38)what is the type interface

39)what is the optional class

40)advan of the optional class

41)what are the java stream?

42)what are teh main component there in java

there are three type component like jvm,jre,jdk

43)different between collection and collections



44)different between constructor and method


45)private comtruction is possible

yes we can make constructor is private 

46)main diffetent betwween platform and other platform

47)what is the default value of the local variable and wgere to store the local and instance variable

48)what are advange of the pacaksge?
* remove the naming collision
* to provide the access protection

49)abstract method to declaer the satic or final

No we cannt create abstruct method static and  final in java

50) can we over load the constructor and finall

yes constructor we can overload but not declear the final

final constructor

no,because constructor called automally

51)different between arraylist and vector

arraylist                                                                                         vector 


ArrayList is not synchronized.	                                                               Vector is synchronized.

ArrayList is not a legacy class. It is introduced in JDK 1.2.	                               Vector is a legacy class.

ArrayList is fast because it is non-synchronized.	                                   Vector is slow because it is synchronized, 

ArrayList uses the Iterator interface to traverse the elements.                         	A Vector can use the Iterator interface or Enumeration interface to traverse the elements.




52 what is the purpose of the iterator  

53) collection vs collections

 collection                                                            collections
  

* is an interface                                                       is a  utility class  --- utility class means--it have set,list ,map

* It doesn't has all static methods                                       It has all static method

*	
It is used to store list of object in a single object                             It is used to operate on collection.

what is the collection?

* collection freamwork is a combination of thr classes and interface which is used to store and manipulate the data in the form of object 

* it is provide various classed like arraylist linkedlist,set......exc 


        array                                                                                                                   collection
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * array is always fixed size
user canot increase or decreas the lendth of the array  according to their requirement at runtime                                 * collection is dynamic size
  
 
* array store only same datatype                                                                                                    * collection stored

*Arrays can hold both object and primitive type data.                                                                              * coolection can hold only object datatype 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



list ----- arraylist ,linkedlist

set------hashset,linked hashset,treeset


map------hashmap,linkedhasp,tree map




set

 * Duplicate element are not allowed

 * is a basic data structure                                      * is a class

 * it is store primitive data type and object                      *it is Strore object only

 * collection of similar datatype                                   * collection of object




Arraylist :
---------

             * arraylist uses a dynamic array to store the element

            * arraylist contain duplicate element or non duplicate element
             
             *it is stroe object only
            

          ad----   * data retrieval is faster

       disad-----    * add and remove of an element at first and middle possition needs to more shift operation

when use  :
---------  

           * if you data is accessing in the list to go for arralist



 method :
          add();
          add(index," ");

Syntax   :  Arraylist (object name) =new Arrayist();




 Linkedlist
-----------


    * linkedlist class uses a doubly linked list to store the element 
 
    * it has data part and link part

     * linked list contain duplicate or non duplicate 

     * linked list maintain insertion order

   *  *it is stroe object only
 

            
   disad---   * data retrieval is slow 
            
   ad----           * data insertion and delete is better        
            


            
  when 
--------
            * data change pannum pothu use pannum linkedlist----> if you manipulate the data to go for linkedlist


specific method
----------------
