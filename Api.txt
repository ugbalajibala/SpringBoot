                                 API(application program interface)
                                 -------------------------------------

what is the api?

*to communicate the two apps

*APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other

*two or more computer programs to communicate with each other.

*two or more software component to communicate with each other 

* An API is a set of programming code that enables two software components to communicate with each other.

for example : zomoto  

* API is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another

*An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. APIs allow different software applications to communicate with each other,

2) when go for api

* if you want to intercat with someone else service you use api  like you create one login page and subit button above to use facebook google 	


what is the feature of the api?

*wireless debugging

what is the rest api ?

*rest api(representational state tranfer)





* all rest api are api but all rest api are not a api 




what is the rest?

*rest is a stands for representational  state transfer 



what is the rest api ?

*application programming interface is a software to software interface that allows otherwise sepatate application to interact  and share data

*rest api is a representational state tranfer protocal it use http request to tranfer data between  client and server 

for example : you upload the video in youyube that video store the server and if you delete that video you use rest api


what is the resource in rest api

*in the rest api architecture every content is a resource 

*it can be a text file ,htmlpages ,images,videos


method of the api
-----------------
* post
*get
*put
*delete

POST: The POST method is used to send data to the server 


GET: The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server


PUT: The PUT method is used to update an existing resource on the server 


Delete: the delete method is used remove the data from server


different between put and patch


put                                                                                                                                      patch

The PUT method is used to completely replace the existing resource with the updated      The PATCH method is used for partial updates to a resource.

Use PUT when you want to replace the entire resource with a new representation.         Use PATCH when you want to apply partial updates to a resource without replacing the entire representation.




10) what is the restful api ?

* RESTful API is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet

11) different between api and restapi

api                                                             restapi





                  Annotation
                 ---------------

1. @Component Annotation:

* @component annotation indicates that an annotated class is a spring bean / component

*the @component annotation tells spring container to automatically create spring bean


2. @autowired annotation

* the @autowired annotation is used to inject the bean automatically

*the @autowired annotation is used in constructor setter and filed injection 

3)@Qualifier annotation

*qualifier annotation is used in conjunction with autowired 



4)@controller

*  @Controller is used to mark classes as controllers for handling web requests,

5)@service

* @Service is used for business logic components, 


6)@repository

* @Repository is used for data access components.

7)@pathvariable

*@PathVariable is used to bind a path variable from the request URL to a method parameter. It
allows you to access dynamic parts of the URL.

8)@requestbody

* @RequestBody is used to bind the
request body to a method parameter

9)@getMapping

10)@postMapping

11)@putMapping

12)@deleteMapping

13)@Springboot Application


Springboot application annotation combination of springboot configurtion and enable auto configuration and component scan

14)@bean

15)@configuration

*configuration annotation helps in spring annotation based configuration 

if you want configure the bean class then you go for configuration annotation 

16)@scope

17)@responseBody

18)@restController

*@RestController is a combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody. It is used to simplify
the creation of RESTful web services by automatically serializing the return value of methods
into the response body.

Spring RestController annotation is used to create RESTful web services using Spring mvc 

19)@requestmapping

*@RequestMapping is used to map web requests to specific controller methods. It allows you to
define the URL path and HTTP methods that should trigger the execution of a particula

20)@RequestParam

*@RequestParam is used to bind request parameters to method parameters in a controller
method. It allows you to extract query parameters from the request URL.

21)@EnableAutoConfiguration

22)@componentScan
